# Surebets and Earnings Log
Surebets and Earnings Log is a website developed to help users track and manage their arbitrage bets (surebets) and monitor overall betting performance. The platform allows users to log detailed information about each surebet, including odds, stake distribution, and expected profits.

The goal of the project is to offer a simple, user-friendly tool for organizing betting activity in one place. With automatic profit calculations and a clear historical overview, users can better understand their earnings, spot trends, and make more informed betting decisions.

Ideal for both beginners and experienced bettors, the platform focuses on ease of use, clarity, and efficiencyâ€”providing a practical solution for anyone looking to take a more structured approach to arbitrage betting.
